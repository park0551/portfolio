MTM6201 Final Project - Portfolio - Taylor Park

## Welcome to my portfolio website!
Thank you for your interest in my portfolio. If you're reading this, it means you're either: 
1. My professor
2. A very curious person

Either way, thank you, and I hope your experience on my website has been a good one.

### How I created my web portfolio
Creating this web portfolio began with UX Design. First, in Adobe XD, I designed my website - that is, how I wanted it to look, and how I wanted all the moving parts to work (including the responsiveness). Because I have so much content to cover between school work, my hobbies, and art I've done for clients, I knew I was going to need a lot of pages. I set myself up for many weeks of work, but in doing so also learned a lot about things like Bootstrap, and other things that help speed up the coding process. I wrote code only for HTML and CSS, and any scripts used were taken from sources like Bootstrap.

#### Challenges and what I learned
1. Bootstrap can be your best friend or your worst enemy
2. Soft-spoken bespectacled people on YouTube are your best friend, always
3. You need a lot more time to code than you think

Bootstrap is great - I used their framework to embed the carousel that you see on the home page. Because this element was so easy to incorporate, I thought I'd try using Bootstrap to add my hamburger dropdown navigation too. This involved a lot of things, and also involved JavaScript, which I haven't learned yet. I was biting off more than I could chew, so I decided to create my own hamburger dropdown menu from scratch. This leads me to my second point:

I had no idea where to start with this dropdown menu. I decided to watch a Kevin Powell YouTube video on the topic, because every time I've watched one of his videos, I've learned something valuable. Using some bits and pieces from his tutorial, I was able to build my own hamburger dropdown navigation using only HTML and CSS. I think YouTube and other platforms can be a valuable resource when learning something like HTML & CSS, which are ever-changing. Everyone has a different experience and perspective on these topics and everyone has some valuable information that another may not.

The main thing I learned when creating this portfolio was that I really did need all of the time alloted for the project. I'm confident that it can only go up from here though, and I can only get faster at coding as I learn and practice more. One of the things that took a surprising amount of time was the ARIA roles and labels, and making sure I sifted through every line of code, so as not to miss something crucial. In hindsight, I would have added these roles and labels as I went instead, but this is something I will definitely do from here on out. 

Another thing I noticed was that I feel like I've developed a better foresight now, after having attempted to code my own prototype. There are many things in my mockup that I didn't foresee as being an issue UI-wise, or in other ways. One of the things was the modular image gallery on the Illustration and Design pages, which was such a pain when I attempted coding it that I decided to just skip the idea altogether. When I had designed this in XD, I thought to myself that this could be a huge pain to figure out, but still designed it anyways. I realize now that it's easy to get over-zealous with the designing, and this is something I will keep in mind from now on. Another thing I did not have the foresight for was the fact that Ko-Fi (one of the social media icons I included in my mockup) icons do not yet exist on any icon set websites, so in order to keep everything consistent and simple in terms of the coding, I decided to use the Twitch.tv icon instead, though I don't really use that site much. There were a lot of little things like this that tripped me up every once in a while. 

#### Afterword
I can't believe I learned this much about web design in just 7 months since starting this course, but here we are! It was a lot of work, but I gained a lot of knowledge and discipline. Now, I have a 100% customizeable portfolio website to build on for the rest of my career, and that's really awesome. Onto Web Development III!
